How exciting of a time we live in! I just finished one year of professional work as a Deep Learning Engineer at a Startup in Tokyo. The sheer number of cool ideas as well as the research pace of the machine learning research field has been truly astonishing. Coming from a Chemical Engineering background, I was fortunate enough to learn a lot of new things along the way and decided to share my experiences and thoughts through this personal blog. This blog will serve several different purposes listed below in random order:

* Share my knowledge (and hopefully learn new things) about tools relevant to Machine Learning and coding in general
* Discuss and share thoughts about recent research papers in the field of AI/ML
* Improve personal writing and blogging skills
* Interact with people that have similar interests

I am truly excited to start this blog and hope you can find something that you will enjoy and like!
