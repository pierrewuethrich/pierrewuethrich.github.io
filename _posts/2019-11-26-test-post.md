How exciting of a time we live in! I just finished one year of professional work as a Deep Learning Engineer at a Startup in Tokyo. The sheer number of cool ideas as well as the research peace of the machine learning academic research field is truly astonishing. I was able to learn a lot along the way and decided to share my experiences and thoughts through this personal blog. This blog will serve different purposes listed below in random order

* Share my knowledge (and hopefully learn new things) about tools relevant to Machine Learning and coding in general
* Discuss and share thoughts about recent research papers in the field of AI
* Improve my writing and blogging skills 
* Interact with people with similar interests
